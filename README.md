# Pricing-Test


Company XYZ sells a software for $39. Since revenue has been flat for some time, the VP of
Product has decided to run a test increasing the price. She hopes that this would increase
revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ($39), while a random
sample of 33% users a higher price ($59).
The test has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding
how it went and whether it would make sense to increase the price for all the users.
Especially he asked you the following questions:

1. Should the company sell its software for $39 or $59?
2. The VP of Product is interested in having a holistic view into user behavior, especially
focusing on actionable insights that might increase conversion rate. What are your main
findings looking at the data?
